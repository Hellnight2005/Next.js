# Next.js
# Getting Started with Next.js

This guide will walk you through creating a simple Next.js application that displays "Hello, World!" on the homepage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Next.js requires Node.js to be installed.

## Creating a Next.js Project

1. **Create a New Next.js Project**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new Next.js project named `hello-world`:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app hello-world
## Navigating to the Project Directory

Once you've created the Next.js project, you need to navigate to the newly created `hello-world` directory using your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
cd hello-world
```
## Running the Development Server

To start the Next.js development server, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
## Accessing Your Application

Once the development server is running, you can access your Next.js application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

This URL corresponds to the local development server where your Next.js application is being served. Opening this URL in your web browser will display your application, including the "Hello, World!" message if you followed the previous steps correctly.

Make sure to keep the development server running while you're accessing your application in the browser. You can leave the terminal or command prompt open where you started the development server.
## Customizing the Page

You can customize the content of the page by modifying the `pages/index.js` file in your project directory. This file contains the code for the homepage of your Next.js application.

### `pages/index.js` Content:

```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```
#Feel free to modify this file to customize the content of your Next.js application.
